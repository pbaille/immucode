#+title: Immutable coding


<2023-01-17 Tue>
I would like the whole coding environment to be immutable

<2023-01-19 Thu>
when adding something to the environment it is immediately compiled, self sufficiant and immutable, no references to outter env
if doing so we will have code duplications when combining existing code fragments
the best thing would be to strip the creation env to its bare minimum and copy it
or to compile to a serie of bindings and a return expression
when combining two forms we could therefore merge their bindings so there is no duplications
should we use hashes ?

if I do not allow env member overides, I can safely bind to a path and be sure that the value will always be the same
it seems to work well
*** todo
- fn and let
- recursive fn

the base is here: let, lambdas, macros, if, recursion
*** todo
- modules
- quasiquote
